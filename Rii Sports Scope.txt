Rii Sports Scope.

project is a native port of wii sports to modern devices using the decompilation, dolphin and a modern engine like unity/godot. the project will also have said dolphin emulator along with cemu and suyu built in with certain modding/decomp/unpacking tools to have "support" for Wii Sports Resort, Wii Sports Club, Switch Sports (maybe), Wii fit, wii fit plus and wii fit u. there will be a custom interface that puts all the sports/features/settings in one place regardless of game and they will all be given a graphical overhaul courtesy of the newer engine. there will be a mii maker (either made from scratch or you have to supply the wii/wiiu/switch (still thinking) menu rom/nand to work it from there), there will also be features like linking to wii/wiiu, save transfering, multiplayer for every game, mod support/tools/page, making shortcuts of each game seperatley to add to steam or any other launcher/library apps, etc.
