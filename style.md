# Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Code Structure
- Organize project files into appropriate directories, separating source files, build files, and data files.
- Maintain a clear and consistent project structure, with new scripts added in relevant locations.
- In Unity projects, organize assets into specific folders (e.g., Resources, Scripts, Scenes) for better organization and maintainability.

## 2. Version Control
- Use version control systems effectively to track changes and manage code history.
- Follow best practices for commit messages, branching, and merging.

## 3. Code Formatting and Organization
- Adhere to consistent code formatting rules across the project.
- Group related code elements together for improved readability and maintainability.

## 4. Unity and C# Specific Guidelines
- Follow Unity-specific coding conventions and best practices.
- Adhere to C# coding standards and utilize language features appropriately.

Note: The provided guidelines did not cover specific rules for Naming Conventions, Documentation, Error Handling, Performance, or Security. These categories should be addressed in a comprehensive code style guide.
