basically a project to port the games from the wii sports and wii fit series to modern devices as one big game in a modern engine like unity or godot

to avoid legal trouble I want to use the wii sports decomp and some emulators (dolphin, cemu, suyu etc) so u have to provide the rom files for the games but idk if we can do that in unity

we may also just ditch using a modern engine and go using raw code
