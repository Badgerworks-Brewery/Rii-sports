# Rii-sports

Rii-sports is an open-source project aiming to recreate and enhance the classic **Wii Sports** and **Wii Fit** games for modern platforms. By leveraging the original game code and assets through emulation, we strive to offer an improved and nostalgic gaming experience that surpasses modern alternatives like Switch Sports.

## Project Goal

Our goal is to port the beloved games from the Wii Sports and Wii Fit series to modern devices, combining them into one comprehensive game built with a modern engine. This project seeks to preserve the charm of the original games while making them accessible on contemporary hardware, ensuring a seamless and enhanced experience for fans and new players alike.

## Technologies

The project is being developed using a modern game engine such as **Unity** or **Godot** (final engine to be determined since Godot's portability and modular nature as an open source engine seemed interesting, but it's most likely Unity since Unity is just the better engine). It utilizes the Wii Sports decompilation ([doldecomp/ogws](https://github.com/doldecomp/ogws)) and references emulators like **Dolphin**, **Cemu**, or **Suyu** to help run the original game code. To avoid legal issues, users must provide their own ROM files for the games.

## Getting Started

To get started with Rii-sports, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Badgerworks-Brewery/Rii-sports.git
   ```
2. Open in Unity or Godot (yes, it is that simple).

## Requirements

- **Software Dependencies for Local Use**:
  - [Unity/Godot]
  - Access to the decompiled games' code (so just Github Desktop).
- **Hardware**:
  - A modern computer with at least:
    - 4 GB RAM
    - Dual-core CPU
    - GPU supporting OpenGL 3.0 or higher

*Note*: Specific requirements will be updated as the project evolves.
