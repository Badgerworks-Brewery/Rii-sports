basically a project to port the games from the wii sports and wii fit series to modern devices as one big game in unity

to avoid legal trouble I want to use the wii sports decomp and some emulators (dolphin, cemu, suyu etc) so u have to provide the rom files for the games but idk if we can do that in unity

we may also just ditch unity and go without an engine or swap to a better one
